# Book Library Project

The Book Library is a simple web application designed to help users manage a collection of books. It allows users to add new books, remove existing ones, and view their entire collection. This project demonstrates the use of basic JavaScript, HTML, and CSS to create a dynamic web page that interacts with the user and stores data locally in the browser's `localStorage`, ensuring that the book collection persists across sessions.

## Features

- **Add a Book**: Users can input book details through a form, including the title, author, publisher, release year, language, and number of pages, as well as mark whether they have read the book.
- **View Library**: Displays all books in the user's library in a visually appealing format.
- **Remove a Book**: Users can remove books from their library.
- **Persistent Storage**: The library is stored in the browser's `localStorage`, so it persists even after the browser is closed or refreshed.
